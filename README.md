PACMANIA
========

### Summary

Mr. Pacman is having mental difficulties, and is staying at a mental hospital. The objective of the player is to guide Pacman through his confused mind and consume all of his medication. Beware, however, Pacman has to get worse before he can get better. 

For each pill Mr. Pacman collects, there is a chance of a ‘ghost’ spawning. The ‘ghost’ blends in to the labyrinth at first, but then You notice. The ‘ghost’ is pure darkness. It radiates negative light, darkening the environment around it. For each pill consumed the chance of spawning an additional ’ghost’ into the labyrinth increases, making his own mind more and more hostile. Thusly, in order to beat PACMANIA, the player must navigate the labyrinth whilst hiding from the increasing number of ’ghosts’ that patrols it. 

PACMANIA is meant to be a challenge, as a too easy experience would negate the horror element. Because of this; the player will be forced to develop several strategies in order to avoid the ’ghosts’ and beat the game.
